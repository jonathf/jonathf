Hello there!

I'm Jonathan, and I am an all-around nerd.

This is most observable online through my
`dotfiles <https://github.com/jonathf/dotfiles>`_. There you can see I like to
tinker around with `awesome wm <https://awesomewm.com>`_,
`qutebrowser <https://qutebrowser.com>`_, and `neovim <https://neovim.io>`_,
among other things. I also have an above average interest in gin, grabbing
about 95 % of my liquor cabinet space. I also would say I have hobbies, but
after children started to occupy my living room, my time to tinker with my
various projects has been reduced a bit.

I have a PhD in applied mathematics and probability theory where I learning a
few things about
`polynomial chaos expansions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_chaos>`_.
I wrote a Python library about it called
`chaospy <https://github.com/jonathf/chaospy>`_, which some people seem to
like. I still maintain it and add some features there now and again.
I also maintain `pyvroom <https://github.com/VROOM-Project/pyvroom>`_ a library
for solving solving various vehicle routing problems.

I love doing research, and if it weren't for the tedious paper and funding
application writing, I'd likely still be doing that. Instead I work for
`Expert Analytics <https://expertanalytics.no>`_, where I mostly work as a
software developer and data scientist, and have a lot fun.
