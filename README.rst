Hello there!

I'm Jonathan,
I am a `Bayesianist
<https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AN2cBr6xKWCB8dRQG/what-is-bayesianism>`_
statistician, Python programmer, all-around geek.

I have a doctorate degree in applied mathematics with a specialization in
uncertainty quantification and in particular, I know a lot about `polynomial
chaos expansions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_chaos>`_.

* I wrote a Python library called `chaospy
  <https://github.com/jonathf/chaospy>`_. As some people seem to like it, I
  maintain it and add features now and again.
* I work for `Expert Analytics <https://expertanalytics.no>`_ as a consultant.
  I code, typically converting state-of-the-art research methods within machine
  learning, statistical and mathematical modeling into usable and deployable
  programs.
* I know a lot of `Python <https://python.org>`_, and I am
  proficient in other languages like
  `Bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash>`_,
  `C++ <https://cplusplus.org>`_,
  `Matlab <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_, and
  `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_.
* I have a deep knowledge of the Python scientific stack, including
  `Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_,
  `Scipy <https://scipy.org>`_,
  `Pandas <https://pands.pydata.org>`_, and
  `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_.
* Within statistical modeling I have work extensively with
  `Scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_,
  `Statsmodels <https://statsmodels.org>`_, and
  `PyMC3 <https://docs.pymc.io>`_.
* Within geological and spacial modeling, I have worked with
  `Geostat <https://geostat-framework.org>`_,
  `Rasterio <https://rasterio.readthedocs.io>`_, and
  `Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io>`_.
* Within machine learning I like to use
  `Tensorflow <https:/tensorflow.org>`_,
  `Xgboost <https://xgboost.readthedocs.io>`_, and some times
  `Pytorch <https://pytorch.org>`_.
* My personal tool stack of choice include
  `awesome <https://awesomewm.com>`_ window manager,
  `fish <https://fishshell.com>`_ shell, and
  `neovim <https://neovim.io>`_ text editor.
  See my `dotfiles repo
  <https://github.com/jonathf/dotfiles>`_ for my
  configuration files on those and other stuff.
* In my personal time I am a gin-enthusiast, and whole bunch of other stuff I
  no longer have time for after I became a father.
