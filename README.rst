Hello there!

I'm Jonathan, and I am an all-around nerd.

I do some stuff stuff!

* I live in downtown Oslo with my family of three.
* I work at my own consultancy `Tuppel <https://www.linkedin.com/company/tuppel>`_ (tuple).
* I am working fulltime as technical lead for the AI team at `Tet Digital <https://www.linkedin.com/company/tet-digital-as>`_.
* I spend most of my development time in the terminal, and have some `dotfiles <https://github.com/jonathf/dotfiles>`_ to show for it.
* I am into ergo-mech keyboards. `Tern BLE <https://gitlab.com/gleb_sexy/tern-ble>`_, which I built myself, is my daily driver.
  Here is my `ZMK configuration <https://github.com/jonathf/zmk>`_.
* I have a PhD in applied mathematics and probability theory from `University of Oslo <https://uio.no>`_
* I tinker a bit with open source projects, like `chaospy <https://github.com/jonathf/chaospy>`_ and `pyvroom <https://github.com/VROOM-Project/pyvroom>`_.
